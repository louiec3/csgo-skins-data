# csgo-skins-data
Collecting data about weapon skins in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Purpose of project:
After a summmer internship working with pandas and creating automation tools, I decided to start my first personal project to use the skills I have learned. 

The main question:
Do the rifles have an equal distribution of weapon skins?

Why this dataset? (include more background and reword)
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has been a game I have played since 2014 and has had a large involvement in my life. The strategic, first person shooter (FPS) game with the purpose of outsmarting your enemies in a coopertive 5v5 fuels the adrenaline in my friends and I to continue playing this game in 2022. This game has an enourmous following, consistently reaching over 500 thousand active players daily in 2022. The best teams in the world compete often in tournements that keep us gamers engaged. 
While the main focus of this game is indeed the gameplay, the developers at Valve created a new dimension to the game: a tradeable market of in-game items. Valve was the first company to introduce purchasable in-game cosmetics (**fact check) and at it, created a new economy similar to the stock market. A stock market of CSGO weapon skins... case openings... changing volume and price value... 
This economy known as the Steam Marketplace is what this project focuses on; the distribution of weapon skins, their rarity, and how these prices align with these factors.

What I hope to achieve:
This project aims to analyze and visualize certain aspects of this market and how fair Valve distributes weapon skins based on the weapon importance and how many are avilable to players (**reword).

Pit falls
- As of 7/17/2022
- Data is based solely off of the steam market
- Release date is based off of first occurance on market. Not definitive release of skin.
- Some skins may not have been sold on the steam market ever resulting in an incomplete dataset (to be confirmed...)
